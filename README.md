### Preview of App:
[//]: <> 

### Context:
[//]: <> This was a solo project during week 3 of Mod 1 at Turing, Front End Program. I completed the project over four days. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> This was a solo project. https://github.com/CBradsen/self-care-center-Mod1,

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> Wrote Javascript, HTML, and CSS from scratch to reporduce a comp mock-up. The learning goals were to: 

- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> During the final minutes before the deadline, I tried again and again to get the user's name to appear on the main page after logging in. I googled and googled, looked through notes. Nothing proved helpful. So I tried every combo I could think of. Finally, it worked. I liked considering and incorporating best UX principles with hover state of buttons and including a preselected clicked button, and text included in the input box. I also practiced using the Dev tools more to understand what needed to change within the CSS.
Though I met the minimum challenge presented in the project, I wanted to be able to do and understand more. Understanding and using correct syntax for HTML and CSS was a challenge. Another challenge I ran up against was trying to think through every step of the Javascript and writing it all at once. A cohort mate suggested I take it a step at a time instead. That proved wise.
